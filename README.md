# Nich

Project projected completion June 13, 2017.

## Compatibility

Currently testing on Chrome (58). Will update for older / different browsers before completion. 

Smaller breakpoints still need some work, largest breakpoint is where most testing and development is taking place. Will resolve before completion.

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
